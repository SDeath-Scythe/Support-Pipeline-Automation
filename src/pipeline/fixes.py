"""Feature flags for candidate fixes under test. All are off unless named in PIPELINE_FIXES.

    PIPELINE_FIXES=some_fix python scripts/run_batch.py ...

A new idea is added here as a flag, measured with and without it (scripts/experiment.py), and then
either made the normal code path or deleted. On 30 Oct the 13 adopted fixes (F2, F3c, F6b, F11,
F12, F14b, F15, F16, F17, F18, F19, F20, F21) became the normal code and every dropped one was
deleted; their history is in docs/experiments/LOG.md and git. No flag is open now.
